# GAN_Review
A Survey and Taxonomy of the Recent GANs Development. Please refer to the details in recent review paper [“Generative Adversarial Networks: A Survey and Taxonomy” Wang, Zhengwei and She, Qi and Ward, Tomas E.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01529.pdf) We also provide a list of papers related to GANs on computer vision here: https://cutt.ly/GAN-CV-paper.

We have classified the two GAN-variants research lines based on recent GAN developments, below we provide a summary and the demo code of these models. We have tested the codes below and tried to summary some of <b>lightweight</b> and <b>easy-to-reuse</b> module of state-of-the-art GANs.
